This is a little chart summarizing tidal currents at different NOAA stations in the San Juan Islands, for 2023. I may post an interactive version, later.

Note: duration is given in minutes, speed is in knots. the two crossbars show median duration and speed. The red circles show today's maximum currents (typically two floods and two ebbs of different magnitude).
